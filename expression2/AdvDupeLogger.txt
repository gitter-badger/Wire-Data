# DESCRIPTION:
#   Simple and effective Expression 2 script for logging advdupe2 clicks (also logs area dupe).
#
# SETUP / INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
#   Spawn this E2. That's it.
#   You will be notified whenever any player (but you) uses advanced duplicator.
#
# Repository URL: https://github.com/CaptainPRICE/Wire-Data
# I think this is pretty simple code, most of it is self-explanatory.
# But, I hope you will learn something new from it. As always, have fun!
