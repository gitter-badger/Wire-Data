#
# INSTALLATION / SETUP:
#   Requires Wire installed and "propcore" Expression 2 extension enabled on the server!
#   Spawn a Wire User (with range set to ~20), then spawn this E2. Wire "User [ENTITY]" input from E2 to "Create Entity [ENTITY]" (entity) output on the Wire User.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Allows you to switch/use the closest 'func_button' entity while driving a vehicle using G key.
#
# Repository URL: https://github.com/CaptainPRICE/Wire-Data
# This is very simple E2, most of it is self explanatory; nothing special about it.
# Have fun, drive like a boss without the need to exit the vehicle in order to switch/use 'func_button' entities!
